I am an incoming PhD student at MIT CSAIL, focusing on the application of computer vision and machine learning to ecological problems. Previously, I was a research assistant at the University of Bonn and worked on the [AMMOD project](https://ammod.de), advised by [Volker Steinhage](https://vsteinhage.github.io). Please feel free to take a look at my projects on GitHub and at my publications below.
