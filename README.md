I'm a first-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Sara Beery](https://beerys.github.io). My research is focused on computer vison approaches for ecological and environmental monitoring. Previously, I was a research assistant at the University of Bonn and worked on the [AMMOD project](https://ammod.de), advised by [Volker Steinhage](https://vsteinhage.github.io).
